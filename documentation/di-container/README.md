# DI-Container

Dependency Injection is the way to go, if you want to create clean and structured code. It helps you to resolve required dependencies for your classes. Keep in mind, dependency injection only works inside the constructor.

We're using [tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) from Microsoft as our di-container solution. It fits all our needs and is really lightweight.

We will not go into how Dependency Injection works, but only how we use it.
