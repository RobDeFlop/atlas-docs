# Discord

## Introduction

We are convinced that nowadays it is no longer necessary to build your own authentication logic. There are now so many services that provide an easy to use OAuth concept. And since we are all gamers, we also assume that discord is an integral part of every gamer.

That's why we directly offer the integration with Discord. Without much setup, use it directly.

Please setup all needed discord credentials inside the environment.json file
{% endhint %}

The framework provides 2 different ways to work with Discord. If you only want to use Discord as authentication means, you don't need a bot. However, if you want to create a whitelist or interact with your gamemode from Discord, it is necessary to create a bot as well.
