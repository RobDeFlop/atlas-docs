# Installation

## Introduction

The installation part is simple as possible for you. You have many options to use the framework.  
The easiest way is to use the template we created for Docker or vanilla usage. However, you can also integrate the system in your own stack by installing the NPM packages yourself.

### Get the packages

If you want to integrate in your own stack, you can install the packages by yourself without using a template. This only describe the way to get the framework, not how to set up in your own environment.

Note that the complete setup has to be done by you. We suggest using one of the templates provided by us.

```text
npm install -D @abstractflo/atlas-server @abstractflo/atlas-client @abstractflo/atlas-shared
```

{% hint style="success" %}
That's all. All required dependencies are installed automatically.
